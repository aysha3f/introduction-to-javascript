// 1.no keywords in variable name
var false = 45;
var var = 13;
// var,false is keyword that's why you cannot use them in variable name.


// 2. no space or gap in variable name
var is happy = false;
var ishappy = true;
// first variable is not correct bcoz you can't use gap is variable name


// 3.no quote
var "address" = "khocu kete";
// this one is wrong because you can't use  quotetion ("") in variable name
